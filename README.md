This is a fork of [Truly Mittal](https://github.com/trulymittal)'s 
# Learn Chakra UI by building a Todo Application with dark mode

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Changes in this Forked Version

This fork primarily adds a few accessibility improvements. One of Chakra UI's interesting features is its ["as" prop](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/layout/box#as-prop).  In a few places I made the HTML more semantic and accessible simply by using this feature. I also added a few aria roles to help those with screen readers.

I expanded the Chakra UI's short-hand parameters and ordered them alphabetically.  These two changes are **completely unnecessary** but I have found it helpful for developers new to a project or unfamiliar with Chakra UI.

I really enjoyed and learned a lot from the the [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/QVnkGqEsbK0) this app came from. If you're just learning about Chakra UI, I recommend it.

## How to Run the React App

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm install`

Installs the application's dependencies.

### `npm start`

Runs the application in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
